## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- Fixed CUDA device loading error: `TypeError in isnan()` when `model.generate()` returns numpy arrays instead of torch tensors ([#13](https://github.com/maemreyo/omnivoice-server/issues/13))
- Improved `_has_nan()` method in `ModelService` to handle both `torch.Tensor` and `np.ndarray` types, as well as nested lists/tuples

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- Initial release of omnivoice-server
- OpenAI-compatible TTS API (`/v1/audio/speech`)
- Three voice modes:
  - Auto: Model selects voice automatically
  - Design: Specify voice attributes (gender, age, accent, etc.)
  - Clone: Voice cloning from reference audio
- Voice profile management API (`/v1/voices/profiles`)
  - Create, read, update, delete voice cloning profiles
  - Persistent storage for reusable voice profiles
- One-shot voice cloning endpoint (`/v1/audio/speech/clone`)
- Streaming synthesis support (sentence-level chunking)
- Model listing endpoint (`/v1/models`)
- Health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Metrics endpoint (`/metrics`)
- CLI interface with `omnivoice-server` command
- Configuration via environment variables or CLI flags
- Optional Bearer token authentication
- Concurrent request handling with configurable limits
- Request timeout protection
- Audio format support: WAV and raw PCM

- Python client examples
- cURL examples
- Streaming audio player example
- Comprehensive documentation
- CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions

### Technical Details

- Built on FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Uses OmniVoice model from k2-fsa
- Supports CUDA, MPS, and CPU inference
- Thread pool executor for concurrent synthesis
- Pydantic-based configuration and validation
- Type hints throughout codebase
- Async/await for I/O operations
